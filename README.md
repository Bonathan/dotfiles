# dotfiles
The collection of all my (current) dotfiles for my Fedora/i3-gaps setup.
* i3-gaps
* polybar
* alacritty
* rofi
* Vim
## i3-gaps
I wanted the ease of i3wm but the gaps and installed i3-gaps. I found out, that there is also i3-rounded-corners but decided not to install it, because I am lazy.
## polybar
The standard i3bar doesn't look great, so I installed polybar. There are still some things I have to figure out, like using icons (for battery and wifi) but I am happy with my rather simple configuration.
## alacritty
Alacritty is currently my favorite terminal emulator, just because it is so simple to configure. I recreated the Seoul256 colorscheme just because I love it so much.
### fm6000
After seeing DT's video about FetchMaster I tried it out and I must say, I really like it.
## rofi
DMenu got replaced by rofi because of the aesthetics.
## NeoVim
I used to daily-drive VSCode. That said, I started using Vim regularly and installed NeoVim. I installed autocompletion plugins, some colorschemes and vim-airline. To see my old configuration open the ```.vimrc``` and for the new NeoVim configuration open ```nvim/init.vim```.
